# Global Enterprise Network Infrastructure & Security

> **Enterprise network simulation featuring multi-site OSPF/BGP routing and advanced Access Control List (ACL) security policies. Built with Cisco Packet Tracer.**

## 🌐 Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a multinational enterprise network for "Global Enterprises." It features 5 interconnected sites (HQ, 2 Branches, Data Center, and a DMZ).

## 🛠️ Key Technologies
* **Networking:** OSPF (Internal Routing), BGP (Inter-domain Routing).
* **Security:** Access Control Lists (ACLs), Device Firewalls, VLAN Segmentation.
* **Wireless:** WPA2-PSK Security.

## 🔒 Security & IAM Highlights
* **Least Privilege:** Configured ACL 110 to restrict FTP access to authorized subnets only.
* **Segmentation:** Separated HR and Finance departments using VLANs to limit internal lateral movement.
* **DMZ Implementation:** Isolated public-facing Web and FTP servers from the internal Data Center.
